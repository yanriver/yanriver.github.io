<h3>Long-term population dynamics under climate change and human impact</h3>
<p>

I am interested in how dynamics of animal populations responds to biotic and abiotic factors. Based on population time series collected from literature, online database and our on-going survey data (small mammals), we applied various statistical modeling methods to test effects of global and local climate, human activities and landscape change on animal populations, in an effort to predict population dynamics and guide agricultural activities, forest management, etc.</p>

<h3>Plant-animal interactions</h3>
<p>
<li>Rodent-seed interaction in forests exhibits an important effect on the dispersal and regeneration of trees. They are usually small and bipartite networks with predation and mutualistic interaction at the same time. We are trying to integrate theoretical, statistical and experimental methods to explore its network structure and dynamics. Currently, I am involved in analyzing rodent-seed networks a fragmented lanscape.</li>
<li>In natural ecosystems,various evidences show species interactions are not always fixed, i.e., a non-monotonic interaction between two species. A change of positive to negative (or negative to positive) effect can exhibit significant effects on the stability of networks. Our theoretical analysis show that specific non-monotonic interactions can increase persistence of ecological networks.</li>
